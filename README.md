# AndyTracker

**Intro**
This is probably one of the _silliest_ projects I've ever worked on, but also one of the most FUN projects i've ever worked on<br>

A couple weeks ago, me and @TTF-fog met [Professor Andy Ruina](http://ruina.org/) at a summer program. We then learnt of his _strange_ approach to privacy, which was to ignore it. He wanted to share his location, 24/7 on his website, something which(thanks to us) is now up at https://ruina.org/location.html<br>

We then had the brilliant(read: stupid) idea of making a device that pointed at him 24/7, leading to this monstrosity

**Design**
This is structured like any 2 axis pan/tilt mechanism, with the blue mini steppers. We did consider using servoes but honestly, we were so bored of using servoes that we decided to use these instead<br>
We also made a small carrier board for the ESP and the motor drivers, along with power delivery<br>
